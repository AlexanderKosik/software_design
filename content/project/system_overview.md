# System overview

We now know our three main requirements that we need to implement:

- Persistance of information
- Providing an interface to request information about available books

We can assume, that the requirements will not be final and will be extended or changed during the lifetime of our system.

## System context
Let's give an overview over our system and the communication partners/clients of our system.
