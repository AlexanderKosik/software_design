# Implementation part III

In this chapter we will provide an interface for our end users. 

## Status Quo:
At this point the RCP should be able to receive json files over network and can persist the information in a database. 

## Providing an interface
We build a REST api for our application. 

If you are using Python as a programming language, you can use FastAPI or Flask as an REST framework. You will find an overview over Python REST API Frameworks [here](https://rapidapi.com/blog/best-python-api-frameworks/).
