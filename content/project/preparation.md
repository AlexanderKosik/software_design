# Preparation

Before we dive into the project you must fulfill some requirements. 

1) Choose a common programming language in your group. You can choose between `Java`, `Python` or `C++`. Other programming languages **are not allowed**, if the material is used as part of a lecture.

2) Within your group agree on an integrated development environment (IDE). Suggestions would be [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/) or [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/idea/) for Java, [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/pycharm/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for Python or [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/clion/) for C++.

3) Create a [github](https://github.com/) account, every group member needs its own github account. When each participant has created an account, **one team member** has to create an empty git repository. If you don't know how to do this, have a look at ["how to create a repo"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo).

													     
4) Share access to the newly created repository between your team members. Have a look at this [description](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-teams-and-people-with-access-to-your-repository) if you don't know how to do this.

4) Download and install a client for the version control system [git](https://git-scm.com/) for your operation system. 

5) Clone your repository on your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/.../...git`

6) Create an empty project in your cloned repository. These steps depend on your chosen IDE. 

7) Commit your empty project structure as a first commit and push it to github.
