# Software Design

This course introduces into the topic 'Software Design'.

It is a hands on introduction based on a "real world" project. During the implementation of the project, impulses on different software engineering topics are interspersed by the lecturer.

In addition to that, course attendees show their current state of implementation several times and get feedback on the design and implementation. The intention is to keep feedback loops short. This is procedure is similar to a code review.
